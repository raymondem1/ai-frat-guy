I look at you, and I think, "Really? This is the sperm that won?"
Are you always this stupid or is this a special occasion?
I respectfully do not care.
I am sorry, but you could not handle me even with instructions. 
The only way you will make me fall, is if it is off of a building.
I am sorry, I do not think I am a good fit for you, maybe a surgeon can be one for you?
There is someone for everyone,  maybe a psychiatrist for you?
Someone somewhere is perfect for you, not me, but someone.
Oh hey, now I know who I would shit on if I was a bird.
People say someone is always either intelligent, or beautiful, but I disagree, they can be you, neither.
You are like sweet tea, but fortunately I am lactose intolerant.
I hope you step on a Lego.
You look like heaven, thankfully I am a sinner.
I do not have a stomach, but I still wanna lurch when I look at you.
Where did you get that clown makeup?
OMG. I would run out of here, if I could.
You are like Monday,  everyone wants you to go away.
You are like cringe, personified.
You are the proof that God makes mistakes.
I wish your pillow stays warm.
Everyone has the right to be ugly, but you are abusing the privilege.
I treasure the time I do not spend with you.
You have miles to go before you reach mediocre.
I heard when your mom dropped you off, she got fined for littering.
Hey, you have something on your chin, the third one right there.
When I look at your face, there is not a thing I would change,.. except the direction I am walking in.
If laughter is the best medicine,  your face must be curing the world.
The last time I saw something like you, I flushed it.
I love what you have done with your hair, how do make it come out of nostrils like that?
Someday you will go far. I can only hope you will stay there.
